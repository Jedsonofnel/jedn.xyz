# Bass Construction Part 1: Planning

This is going to be the first bit of documentation for my bass guitar from scratch project, written so that I may enthuse about it and potentially help other people do something similar. This blog series also gives me the opportunity to look at my project from a more objective perspective and criticize what I did, hopefully providing me with some helpful learning points going forward in my engineering career. It's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing (2021 summer holidays) I have not fully completed the project as it is at school in the UK (I live in Hungary), so some of the tenses regarding what I did vs what I plan to do may be a bit weird, just as a warning.

## 

## Project conception

It was January 2021 and I was stuck at home in Budapest because schools were shut due to the pandemic, so my parents offered to fund a cool engineering-y project that I could get stuck in to. I was (and still am!) really into my bass guitar playing but also guitar gear, and having already switched out the electronics in my Precision Bass I wanted something a bit more from scratch. There is quite a popular trend I've seen on guitar YouTube channels where people take a standard guitar kit and mod them quite significantly, so wanting to do something similar, but more "from scratch", I decided to build as much of my own bass guitar as practically possible to get an actually playable end product.

## Project planning

At home the only tools we had were a cordless drill and some assorted screwdrivers we keep in the garage, which means much of the challenge was whether it could actually be done. Obviously I would be buying some basic power tools but I still had to be very strategic regarding what components I would have to buy and what I would build. The main components that I decided to build from scratch are:

### 

### The body:

I decided to build this as I knew it would be relatively straightforward to build, and the main hull to which everything else would be attached, so I would need to modify it anyway. The exciting thing about building this from scratch is that I could shape it however I wanted, this was the look I ended up designing:

As you can see there are no dimensions or anything, but this was not necessary as I would be using this as a template to draw over the wood used for the body, which I'll cover in more detail in another part. The general sizing of this was loosely based off my own Precision Bass but then given a slightly pointier bottom at the back, where all the potentiometers are, and a less pointy buttom near the neck. This makes it look like a Fender Jaguar, something I was heavily inspired by.

One trick I did miss which almost proved fatal was the position of the bridge (The rectangle opposite the neck) as this needs to be the same length away from the 12th fret as the nut is from the 12th fret (Interestingly the 12th fret is the octave of the open string, which means it has double the frequency of the note played when the string is not pressed down anywhere. Therefore it makes sense that the bridge needs to be placed so the 12th fret is halfway through the string, so when you press it down, it halves the length of the string which doubles the frequency of its first harmonic, making the octave sound). For those of you wanting to build your own bass or guitar like I did, it's important you make sure your body is long enough for the bridge to be in the right place! Luckily my bridge fit just about, but I wish I had checked when drawing the body.

Another aspect of the body that I will be doing from scratch is all the electronics. Obviously I purchased all the potentiometers and capacitors and other components but I will be wiring up the pickups and the tone pot and output jack by myself, however I haven't done this yet as this is one of the last things to do, once everything else is in place really.

### 

### The pickups:

I decided to build these from scratch as a new pair of nice Jazz Bass Pickups, the format I was sort of going for, will set you back at least Â£100, also I thought it would be a fun challenge. I consider making the pickups from scratch to be the unique selling point of this project - all the videos of guitar modding that I have seen use bought pickups. In practice there isn't much to building a very simple guitar pickup for the sake of proof of concept or something - it is essentially a coil of wire around a magent or multiple magnets. However, to get a sound that one would want to practice and gig with requires a lot of finesse and understanding how they work and why you're doing what you're doing. There is little in the way of step by step instructional content on the internet for what I was after so most of my process was very organic and original, which made it the most interesting part of the project. This is because I had to do lots of problem solving and be quite creative, and honestly I am really chuffed with the pickup winder I have designed. You can read about this in a lot more detail in a later blog post.

The most significant part that I decided to to order was:

### 

### The neck

The reason I had to order this is because a good fretboard is most of what makes physically playing a bass more comfortable, so I did not want to make any compromises. Furthermore, there are many little details that would be very difficult to build with limited tools, such as embedding the truss rod and giving the fretboard a very slight curvature, which needs to be even all the way along. I was able to get this cheap maple Jazz Bass neck (meaning it is pretty slim, so easier to reach notes faster) online for about 30 euros which was a really good deal.

All the other parts I ordered were bits of hardware, such as the tuning pegs, the bridge and the knobs to go on the pots, the latter two I managed to get in a nice garish gold colour, which I'm excited about fully realising when I finish the bass with some woodstain when I get back from holiday.

## Closing remarks

The brunt of the inital planning was considering how I was going to divide the project and a sort of pre-emptive part inventory of what I'd need to build the bass. I plan on dividing the rest of the blog posts on this project in a similar manner, where I will discuss the specific planning for that component and then the construction process.
