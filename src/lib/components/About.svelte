  <h2>About me:</h2>

  <p>
    Hi I'm Jed and I am a very interesting person. I am a big fan of programming
    as I can feel productive while actually watching reading about the new and
    exciting javascript framework that is guaranteed to rock your world and
    change your life. The current framework I am addicted to is called Svelte
    and I highly reccomend you check it out. An astute reader will note that to
    be an interesting person you have to have more than one interest so here are
    some others of mine: playing guitar, long distance running, playing bass and
    building and modifying guitars.
