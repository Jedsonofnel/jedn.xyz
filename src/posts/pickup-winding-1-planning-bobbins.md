  the bobbins.

Guitar pickups essentially turn the vibrations of steel guitar strings into current which an amplifier can deal with.  As a result, the guitar pickups make up 99% of a guitar's tone.  A good neck and body can make a guitar feel nice to play, and while finesse as a player certainly impacts the noise you make, it all hinges on the pickups.  While, of course, the pickups found in mainstream guitar lines today are built in factories according to a very precise specification, the development of guitar pickups has very much been interwoven with the development of modern guitar based music, and as a result, pickup widing has become something of an art form.  All this to say that there is very, very little in the way of prescriptive pickup winding methods or guidelines so most of what I have done to wind my own pickups has bene done based loosely off manufacturers websites, hobbyist Youtube channels and my own experimentation.

## How do pickups work?

Physically, guitar pickups are essentially coils of wire around a bobbin with a magnetic center.

The magnetic pole pieces in the center of the bobbin create a magnetic field which makes the steel string directly above into a temporary magnet, this works because steel is ferromagnetic so the magnetic dipoles contained within will line up when exposed to a permanent field (the pole magents).  Then, as the steel string vibrates above the pickup, the magnetic field of the temporary magnet inducts a current in the coil of wire around the bobbin.  As the strings vibrate, the magnetic field rapidly switches direction in relation to the coil, which means the inducted current is an alternating current.  It is this alternating current that can then be sent to an amplifier.  This is a very neat example of Faraday's law of induction with the added benefit of funky fresh bass lines as a result.

## How do you go about making them?

Firstly you need your bobbin - this is fairly straightforward to build.  You need some pole magnets and flatwork to go on either side.  You then need to wind the pickups, which sounds much easier than it is; this varies depending on the pickup design but you will need generally around 8000 winds of wire around the magnets.  Having wound the pickups you can attach wires to the either end of the coil and then seal them, which is often done in molten wax, in order to prevent them from becoming microphonic.

## Making the bobbins

For the magnet cores I ordered some pole magnets online.  I then designed the flatwork in Solidworks and laser cut them:

The holes for the magnets were designed to have a very tight tolerance with the magnets so I could securely use friction to attach everything.  The holes in the bridge pickup were also slightly further apart than the neck pickup due to the way the strings are spaced on a guitar:

I then hammered in some brass eyelets into the base flatwork to be used as a terminal to solder the ends of the coil onto and then the wire that will carry the signal to the tone controls and output jack.  I had to do this very delicately to avoid splitting any of the acryllic.

Finally I was able to press the flatwork together with the magnets to make my bobbins:

One modification I had to make to the design was to add another layer to the bass so I could sink the brass eyelets.  This modification had to be made because the part of the brass eyelet that was sticking out would catch the copper wire and ruin the wind.

Next post I will explain my winding process.
