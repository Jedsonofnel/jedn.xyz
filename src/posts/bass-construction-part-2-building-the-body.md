title: 'Bass Construction Part 2: Building the body'
excerpt: Part two of my bass guitar blog series, details on how I built the body of
  the bass.

---
This blog post is going to document how I built the body of my bass guitar.  Most of the work was done in Budapest, where I live, but I finished this off at school in the Design and Technology workshop, which is much better equipped.

## Planning

Heavily inspired by [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Ar2qn5ZO8&t=1053s) I decided that for the body's material I would use lengths of 2 by 4 pine glued together with a thin layer of plywood glued on top as a sort of veneer.  When it comes to guitar wood, manufacturers like Fender and Gibson will use many different tonewoods, most frequently Basswood, Mahogany or Maple.  While expensive woods will have all lovely and unique timbres, when it comes to electric guitars, the vast majority of the tone comes from the pickups, rather than the resonating of the wood.  Furthermore, nice guitar wood can be expensive, I wasn't up to the challenge of trying to source some in Hungary, and even if I did get expensive wood I wouldn't be able to do it justice with my small jigsaw.  All this to say, I think that the downsides of not using tonewood are pretty negligible unless you know you are going to be working to a very high quality.

As part of planning I also drew this quick sketch of what I wanted the shape of the body to be.  I mentioned and explained this in my previous blog post, so check that out if you haven't, but it's worth mentioning that the one dimension worth getting is the position of the bridge, as this could prove fatal later on.

For those who don't know:

> **The bridge needs to be the same distance away from the 12th fret as the nut (where the strings get pressed down at the headstock).**

I briefly explained this in the last blog post but the physics behind this has to do with waves in a string.  In music an octave is an interval where one note has double the frequency of the other, and this ratio means that the notes are said to be the "same".  As there are 12 notes, the note played on the 12th fret needs to be the same note, just an octave up, as the open string note.  Therefore, when you fret the 12th fret, the frequency of the first harmonic of the string needs to double.  As the frequency of the first harmonic is inversely proportional to the string's length, if you halve the length of the string by pressing it down at the 12th fret, then the frequency of the first harmonic (the main pitch heard, the other harmonics are "overtones" that add flavour to the note) doubles, creating the octave.  What this all means is the bridge, which acts as the other end of the string to the nut, needs to be placed so that the halfway point of the string is at the 12th fret.  This is, in essence, how adjusting intonation works when you setup your guitar, just on a smaller scale.

## The process

I started by measuring and cutting the 2 x 2m of 2-by-4 into 5 lengths of 600mm with a jigsaw, and then sanding down the shorter long edges with an orbital sander to get them as flat and ready to glue:

I lined them up in the way that fit the best and glued two together and then three together and then the two and the three together to make the final rectange:

I put this rectangle on the sheet of plywood I'd bought and sketched it's outline, which I then cut out with the jigsaw again.  I had to use many tables and clamps to keep it steady as it was a large sheet of plywood.  Having sanded down one of the large faces of the glued-together rectangle of wood, I applied immense quantities of wood glue and clamped the sheet and face together, leaving it overnight with a load of weights on it.  With the wood all stuck together I then traced out the shape of the body I had sketched out:

I then took the jigsaw to it.  This was very difficult as the jigsaw was only just about long enough and not very powerful.  I had to go slowly and let the blade do the work rather than push because when I pushed I slightly burned the wood:

...and finished:

When I finished cutting out the shape I used a plunge router with a beveled bit to curve off the edges on both sides.  Luckily I had some 2-by-4 left over to test the router on and get the bit locked at the right height, something I really dislike about plunge routers.  I then also used the router to cut out a slot for the guitar neck to go, which was very difficult because it was hard to see the lines I drew, so it was a bit wonky but good enough - I can used the gaps to store guitar picks like Johnny Greenwood.

Fortunately or unfortunately school then started with two weeks to go until Easter, so I had to fly back to the UK.  With a go-ahead from the head of DT at my school, my Dad very kindly and carefully shipped all the bass components over to my school in the UK, so after Easter when they had all arrived I was able to continue with the project.  Because the school workship is significantly better equipped than I was at home, I was able to use drum, bobbin and belt sanders, a nicer palm router and a milling machiine to significantly speed up the sanding process and clean up a few edges.  What I did was use the bobbin sander to clean up the sides where the jigsaw hadn't been perfectly straight; use the drum sander to sqaure up a slight bow in the body, and use the milling machine to make the neck pocket much cleaner:

I then went over the bevelled edges which work on the bobbin sander had slightly ruined:

I then used the belt sander to carve away a slope in the top corner of the guitar to make resting the upper arm more comfortable on a bass, which is particularly important for me when I slap because it allows my hand to rest beneath the strings so I get more accurate slaps with better tone.

![Sanding the slap slope](https://res.cloudinary.com/jedn-web-dev/image/upload/t_basic_blog/v1633544423/jeds_hut/cfc933c79ac687fd7530981c9b9d0a47.jpg "Slap Slope Sanding")

Having done this I then planed it to make it a bit more straight and then went over all the edges with a sanding block to get them all nice and smooth and comfortable.

Finally I was able to attach the neck with some screws and a backplate I had ordered and the bridge and string everything up, at this point I was now ready to start working on the pickups:

Thank you for reading!  The next post will be an introduction to my bass pickup winding experience.
