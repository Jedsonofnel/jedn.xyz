# My Blog!

Just a little blog/portfolio thing.  Good to have my name somewhere in the
interwebs.  I use forestry.io as a git based cms.  Simple and effective!

## Reproducing locally:

```
# clone wherever you want
git clone github.com/Jedsonofnel/jedn.xyz

# install dependencies
npm install

# run!
npm run dev
```
